Permissions it requires:
View Messages, Ping @everyone here and all roles.
It also requires a security ping so it can alert people. Edit it in the area message.channel.send('<@&873632222907859004>')}; and change the id to the roles
It mentions delete message but if it does delete a message it will error, so do not let it delete messages.


Requires: npm install discord.js
